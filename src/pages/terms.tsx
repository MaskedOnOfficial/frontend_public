However, we reserve the right to request identity verification at any time and to terminate Accounts where there is reasonable suspicion of age misrepresentation.</p>
            <p>3.3 If you are using the Platform on behalf of a business, organisation, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case "you" and "your" shall also refer to that entity.</p>
            <p>3.4 The Platform is intended primarily for users based in India. Users located outside India may access the Platform but do so at their own risk and are solely responsible for compliance with the laws of their local jurisdiction. MaskedOn makes no representation that the Platform or its content is appropriate or available for use in jurisdictions outside India.</p>
            <p>3.5 Users who have been previously suspended or permanently banned from the Platform are not permitted to re-register. Creating duplicate accounts to evade a ban is a material breach of these Terms.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="4. Account Registration and Security">
            <p>4.1 To access certain features of the Platform, you must create an Account by providing accurate, current, and complete information as required during the registration process.</p>

            <p>4.3 You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account. MaskedOn shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the security of your Account.</p>
            <p>4.4 MaskedOn reserves the right to disable or suspend your Account at any time if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have provided false information, breached these Terms, or if your Account security has been compromised.</p>

          </Section>

          <Section title="5. Nature of the Platform — Intermediary Status">
            <p>5.1 MaskedOn is an online intermediary platform as defined under Section 2(1)(w) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Intermediary Guidelines, 2021.

            <p>5.2 MaskedOn is not a party to any agreement or transaction between Hosts and Guests. The Host is solely and exclusively responsible for the Event they create, including its legality, safety, accuracy of information, and fulfilment of any commitments made to Guests.</p>
            <p>5.3 MaskedOn acts as a payment aggregator for the limited purpose of facilitating ticket transactions through Razorpay. This does not constitute MaskedOn's assumption of any liability with respect to the underlying Event or transaction.</p>
            <p>5.4 MaskedOn shall observe the due diligence obligations prescribed under the Intermediary Guidelines, including but not limited to taking down unlawful content upon receiving actual knowledge or a government/court order.</p>

              <li>Transmit or distribute any malware, virus, Trojan horse, or any other code designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorised access to any system;</li>
              <li>Scrape, crawl, spider, data-mine, or otherwise extract information from the Platform by automated means without our prior written consent;</li>

          </Section>

          <Section title="7. Host Responsibilities and Event Listings">
            <p>7.1 <strong className="text-text">Accuracy of Listings.</strong> Hosts are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and legality of all information in their Event listing, including the event name, description, venue address, date, start time, end time, maximum capacity, ticket price, guest requirements, and any content restrictions.</p>
            <p>7.2 <strong className="text-text">Legal Compliance.</strong> Hosts represent and warrant that each Event they list complies with all Applicable Laws, including:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Local municipal laws, zoning regulations, and noise ordinances applicable to the venue;</li>
              <li>Maximum occupancy limits prescribed by fire safety and building regulations;</li>
              <li>Applicable state excise laws if the Event involves the service or consumption of alcohol;</li>
              <li>Any licences, permits, or no-objection certificates required for hosting the Event at the designated venue;</li>
              <li>Police permission requirements for public gatherings where applicable under state law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>7.3 <strong className="text-text">Alcohol and 18+ Events.</strong> Hosts who list Events involving the service or consumption of alcohol must clearly indicate this in their Event listing. Hosts must comply with the excise laws of the state in which the Event is held, obtain all required licences, and ensure that alcohol is not served to persons under the legal drinking age in that state. MaskedOn does not endorse, authorise, or accept responsibility for the lawful service of alcohol at any Event. The Host alone bears all liability for violations of excise law.</p>
            <p>7.4 <strong className="text-text">Attendee Safety.</strong> Hosts are responsible for the safety and reasonable well-being of attendees at their Events. MaskedOn strongly recommends that Hosts:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Ensure the venue is safe and compliant with fire safety and structural regulations;</li>
              <li>Have a plan for medical or other emergency situations;</li>
              <li>Not permit attendance beyond the venue's legally permitted capacity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>7.5 <strong className="text-text">Guest Approval (Gatekeeper Role).</strong> Hosts are the sole decision-makers regarding which Guests to admit to their Event. MaskedOn does not intervene in this process. Hosts may set minimum Trust Gate rating thresholds and other eligibility criteria, provided that such criteria do not constitute discrimination in violation of Section 6.2.</p>
            <p>7.6 <strong className="text-text">Event Cancellation by Host.</strong> If a Host cancels an Event after Guests have purchased Tickets, the Host must notify all affected Guests through the Platform as soon as practicable. Refunds will be processed in accordance with Section 12. The Host acknowledges that cancellations negatively impact their Social Rating and their standing on the Platform.</p>
            <p>7.7 <strong className="text-text">MaskedOn Not a Co-Organiser.</strong> MaskedOn's facilitation of ticket sales, attendee management, and event discovery does not make MaskedOn a co-organiser, co-host, promoter, or agent of any Event. MaskedOn expressly disclaims all liability arising from the conduct, cancellation, safety, or failure of any Event.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="8. Guest Responsibilities">
            <p>8.1 Guests are responsible for reviewing all Event details before requesting or purchasing a Ticket, including venue, date, time, dress code, capacity, age requirements, and any terms imposed by the Host.</p>
            <p>8.2 Guests represent and warrant that they meet all eligibility criteria specified by the Host, including minimum Social Rating requirements set via the Trust Gate feature.</p>
            <p>8.3 Guests must comply with the rules, instructions, and reasonable requests of the Host and venue management at all times during an Event. MaskedOn is not responsible for any Guest's conduct during an Event.</p>
            <p>8.4 Guests acknowledge that attendance at an Event is entirely at their own risk. MaskedOn does not verify the safety, legality, or suitability of any Event venue or the truthfulness of any Event listing.</p>
            <p>8.5 Guests must not misrepresent themselves to a Host (e.g., through a false Social Rating, fake profile, or proxy account) to gain admission to an Event they would otherwise not qualify for. Such misrepresentation constitutes a material breach of these Terms.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="9. Ticketing">
            <p>9.1 Tickets issued through the Platform are digital and non-transferable unless the Host expressly permits transfers in their Event listing.</p>
            <p>9.2 A Ticket constitutes a revocable licence to attend the Event and does not create any contractual obligation on MaskedOn to ensure your attendance. The Host retains the right to refuse admission in accordance with their Event rules, provided such refusal is not on discriminatory grounds as described in Section 6.2.</p>
            <p>9.3 Ticket availability is subject to Event capacity limits set by the Host. MaskedOn does not guarantee Ticket availability for any Event.</p>
            <p>9.4 MaskedOn does not verify the credentials, legal compliance status, or identity of Hosts. Purchasing a Ticket to any Event is at the Guest's own risk and judgment.</p>
            <p>9.5 Any secondary or resale market for Tickets is strictly prohibited without MaskedOn's prior written consent. Tickets must not be sold, auctioned, or transferred at a price higher than their face value. Violation of this clause may result in Account termination and cancellation of associated Tickets without refund.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="10. Payments and Transaction Processing">
            <p>10.1 <strong className="text-text">Payment Gateway.</strong> All financial transactions on the Platform, including Ticket purchases and Platform Fee collections, are processed by Razorpay Software Private Limited ("Razorpay"), a third-party payment service provider regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. Your use of Razorpay's services is governed by Razorpay's own terms and conditions and privacy policy available at www.razorpay.com. MaskedOn is not responsible for any failure, error, or delay caused by Razorpay.</p>
            <p>10.2 <strong className="text-text">Currency.</strong> All prices displayed on the Platform are in Indian Rupees (INR). Ticket prices are stored internally in paise (1 INR = 100 paise) and displayed rounded to the nearest rupee. International payment cards may attract foreign exchange conversion fees charged by your card issuer, for which MaskedOn accepts no responsibility.</p>
            <p>10.3 <strong className="text-text">Payment Authorisation.</strong> By initiating a payment, you authorise MaskedOn and Razorpay to charge the payment method you have provided for the total amount displayed at checkout, including the Ticket price, MaskedOn Platform Fee, Razorpay processing fee, and applicable taxes.</p>
            <p>10.4 <strong className="text-text">Transaction Security.</strong> MaskedOn does not store your full card details on our servers. All payment card data is handled by Razorpay in accordance with PCI-DSS security standards. MaskedOn is not responsible for any unauthorised access to payment information that occurs at the Razorpay level or through a payment network breach.</p>
            <p>10.5 <strong className="text-text">Payment Failures.</strong> If a payment fails or is declined, your Ticket booking shall not be confirmed. MaskedOn is not liable for payment failures caused by network issues, bank declines, or Razorpay downtime. In the event of a double charge or erroneous deduction, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@maskedon.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">team@maskedon.com</a> within seven (7) days of the transaction date.</p>
            <p>10.6 <strong className="text-text">Taxes.</strong> You are responsible for all applicable taxes on your purchases. MaskedOn will collect and remit Goods and Services Tax (GST) and any other taxes as required under Applicable Law. Tax invoices may be requested by writing to <a href="mailto:team@maskedon.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">team@maskedon.com</a>.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="11. Platform Fees">
            <p>11.1 MaskedOn charges fees for facilitating Events and transactions through the Platform. These fees may include:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              <li><strong className="text-text">Host Commission:</strong> A percentage of the gross Ticket revenue collected from Guests, deducted before disbursement to the Host. The applicable percentage is disclosed to the Host during the Event creation flow and may vary based on the Event type, pricing, or tier.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-text">Guest Platform Fee:</strong> A flat or percentage-based fee added to the Ticket price payable by Guests at checkout. This fee is clearly disclosed prior to payment confirmation and forms part of the total amount charged.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-text">Subscription / Premium Features:</strong> MaskedOn may offer optional subscription plans or premium features to Hosts or Guests. The pricing, billing cycle, and scope of any such subscription will be separately disclosed at the point of purchase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>11.2 Razorpay charges its own transaction processing fees separately from MaskedOn Platform Fees. Razorpay fees are governed by your agreement with Razorpay and are typically deducted at source from transaction proceeds.</p>
            <p>11.3 MaskedOn reserves the right to modify its fee structure at any time. Changes to fees will be communicated to you at least fourteen (14) days in advance via the Platform and/or email. Continued use of the Platform after the effective date of a fee change constitutes acceptance of the revised fees.</p>
            <p>11.4 All Platform Fees are non-refundable except as expressly stated in the Refund Policy under Section 12.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="12. Refund and Cancellation Policy">
            <p>12.1 <strong className="text-text">Guest-Initiated Cancellation.</strong> If a Guest cancels their Ticket, a refund will be processed for the Ticket face value, less (a) the MaskedOn Platform Fee applicable to that transaction and (b) the Razorpay payment processing fee. The Platform Fee and Razorpay fees are non-refundable in all circumstances.</p>
            <p>12.2 <strong className="text-text">Host-Initiated Cancellation.</strong> If a Host cancels an Event after Guests have purchased Tickets, MaskedOn will initiate refunds for all affected Guests for the Ticket face value, less (a) the MaskedOn Platform Fee and (b) the Razorpay payment processing fee. MaskedOn will not refund any Host commission or subscription fees in such circumstances.</p>
            <p>12.3 <strong className="text-text">Timing of Refunds.</strong> Refund processing timelines are subject to Razorpay's and the relevant bank's processing cycles, which typically range from five (5) to ten (10) business days from the date of initiation. MaskedOn is not responsible for delays in refund credit attributable to your bank or Razorpay.</p>
            <p>12.4 <strong className="text-text">No Show.</strong> If a Guest fails to attend an Event for which they hold a confirmed Ticket, no refund will be issued unless the Event has been cancelled by the Host or MaskedOn determines an exceptional circumstance exists at its sole discretion.</p>
            <p>12.5 <strong className="text-text">Free Events.</strong> No monetary refund applies to free Events. Cancellation of a reservation for a free Event does not attract any charge or monetary penalty, but repeated no-shows may negatively impact a Guest's Social Rating at the Host's discretion.</p>

MaskedOn's determination on refund disputes shall be final and binding, subject to any statutory rights you may have under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.</p>

          <Section title="13. Social Rating System">
            <p>13.1 <strong className="text-text">Overview.</strong> The MaskedOn Social Rating system allows Users to rate one another on a scale of 1 to 5 stars following an Event they both attended. Ratings are voluntary and reflect the rater's subjective assessment. The Social Rating displayed on a User's profile is a recency-weighted average and is only made publicly visible once a User has received a minimum of three (3) ratings.</p>
            <p>13.2 <strong className="text-text">Nature of Ratings.</strong> Social Ratings on MaskedOn are purely social and reputational in nature. They are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as, a credit score, financial assessment, background check, employment reference, or any other formal evaluation for regulated or statutory purposes. MaskedOn expressly disclaims all liability for any consequence arising from a User's Social Rating beyond the context of the Platform.</p>
            <p>13.3 <strong className="text-text">Rating Integrity.</strong> MaskedOn reserves the right to investigate, modify, withhold, or permanently remove ratings that are found to be:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Submitted by fake, duplicate, or inauthentic accounts;</li>
              <li>Part of a coordinated manipulation campaign or "review bombing";</li>
              <li>Submitted under coercion, inducement, or bribery;</li>
              <li>Otherwise in violation of these Terms or our community standards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>13.4 <strong className="text-text">Unfavourable Ratings.</strong> Ratings will not be removed solely because they are negative or unfavourable to the rated User, provided they comply with these Terms. The integrity of honest peer feedback is fundamental to the Platform.</p>
            <p>13.5 <strong className="text-text">No Factual Adjudication.</strong> MaskedOn does not adjudicate the factual accuracy of any individual rating. Disagreements regarding the content of a rating must be resolved between the parties directly. MaskedOn may remove a rating only for violations of these Terms, not based on disagreement with its subjective content.</p>
            <p>13.6 <strong className="text-text">Consequences of Low Rating.</strong> A low Social Rating may limit your ability to join Events that use the Trust Gate feature. MaskedOn does not guarantee any minimum Social Rating to any User and is not liable for any opportunity lost or access denied on account of your Social Rating.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="14. Trust Gate Feature">
            <p>14.1 The Trust Gate feature allows Hosts to set a minimum Social Rating threshold, below which Guest join requests will be automatically declined for their Event. This threshold is established entirely at the Host's discretion and is communicated to prospective Guests on the Event listing.</p>
            <p>14.2 MaskedOn is not the decision-maker in the Trust Gate process. We provide the technological mechanism only. The Host's choice of threshold, and the resulting admission or exclusion of any Guest, is the Host's sole responsibility.</p>
            <p>14.3 Guests who do not meet a Host's Trust Gate threshold will be unable to submit a join request for that Event. This is a platform-enforced feature operating at the Host's request and does not constitute discrimination by MaskedOn.</p>
            <p>14.4 Hosts must ensure that their use of the Trust Gate feature does not result in discrimination based on grounds prohibited by Applicable Law (see Section 6.2). MaskedOn reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate enforcement action, including removal of the Event, against any Host whose Trust Gate criteria appear designed to target protected characteristics.</p>
