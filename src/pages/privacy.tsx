            </ul>
            <p>MaskedOn does <strong className="text-text">not</strong> directly collect or store biometric data (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition data). On mobile devices, device-level biometric authentication (Face ID, fingerprint unlock) may be used to access the application; this is handled entirely by your device's operating system and the relevant hardware. MaskedOn receives no biometric data from this process.</p>
            <p>MaskedOn will not collect SPDI unless it is either necessary for the lawful purpose for which the data was provided or you have provided explicit written consent for the specific use.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="4. Legal Basis and Purposes for Processing">
            <p>MaskedOn processes your personal data under the following lawful bases:</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">4.1 Consent (primary basis)</strong></p>
            <p>By registering and using the Platform, you provide free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous consent to the processing of your personal data for the purposes described in this Policy. Your consent is recorded at registration with a timestamp. You may withdraw consent at any time by deleting your Account; however, withdrawal of consent may result in your inability to use the Platform.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">4.2 Contractual Necessity</strong></p>
            <p>Processing your registration data, profile data, event activity data, and transaction data is necessary to perform our obligations under the Terms of Service that constitute a contract between you and MaskedOn.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">4.3 Legitimate Interest</strong></p>
            <p>We process certain technical data (IP addresses, server logs, device metadata) to protect the security and integrity of the Platform, detect and prevent fraud, and ensure lawful use, where such processing does not override your rights and interests.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">4.4 Legal Obligation</strong></p>
            <p>We may process and retain personal data where required to comply with Applicable Law, including tax and accounting regulations, and in response to lawful requests from regulatory or judicial authorities.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">4.5 Specific Purposes of Processing</strong></p>
            <p>Your personal data is processed for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Creating, authenticating, and managing your Account;</li>

              <li>Processing payments and maintaining transaction records via Razorpay;</li>
              <li>Sending push notifications (only with your prior opt-in consent);</li>
              <li>Detecting, investigating, and preventing fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity on the Platform;</li>
              <li>Responding to user support requests, grievances, and legal inquiries;</li>
              <li>Complying with obligations as an intermediary under the IT Act and Intermediary Guidelines, including responding to lawful takedown or disclosure orders;</li>
              <li>Analysing usage patterns, feature engagement, and Platform interaction data — both in aggregate and at an individual level — to improve user experience, develop new features, personalise content, and enhance overall service quality;</li>
              <li>Marketing and promoting the Platform, including using voluntarily shared User Content as described in the Terms of Service (Section 15).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>MaskedOn will endeavour to process personal data only for purposes compatible with those listed above. Where processing for a new purpose is required and that purpose is not covered by a legitimate use under Applicable Law, MaskedOn will obtain fresh consent before commencing such processing.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="5. Sensitive Personal Data — Special Protections">
            <p>5.1 MaskedOn will not collect SPDI from you unless it is necessary for a lawful purpose and either: (a) you have provided explicit written consent after being informed of the purpose; or (b) the collection is required by law.</p>
            <p>5.2 SPDI will not be shared with any third party without your explicit consent, except where disclosure is required by law, court order, or a government authority. Where disclosure is required, we will notify you to the extent permitted by law.</p>
            <p>5.3 SPDI will be processed only for the specific purpose for which consent was obtained and will be retained only for as long as necessary for that purpose or as required by Applicable Law.</p>
            <p>5.4 MaskedOn will implement reasonable security practices to protect SPDI, as prescribed by Rule 8 of the SPDI Rules and Section 43A of the IT Act.</p>
            <p>5.5 Your password is stored as a one-way bcrypt hash with a per-password salt. MaskedOn cannot retrieve or view your original password. In the event of a security incident involving password hashes, the hashes are computationally resistant to reversal by design.</p>

The laws of those jurisdictions may differ from Indian law and may offer a different level of protection for personal data.</p>
            <p>7.3 MaskedOn takes the following measures to ensure an adequate level of protection for cross-border data transfers:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Engaging only Data Processors who have contractually committed to processing data in accordance with applicable data protection standards;</li>
              <li>Selecting processors that maintain industry-recognised certifications (e.g., Supabase's SOC 2 compliance, Google's ISO 27001 certification);</li>
              <li>Ensuring that financial data processed by Razorpay is handled within India under RBI-compliant frameworks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>7.4 MaskedOn will comply with any cross-border transfer restrictions or requirements that may be notified by the Indian government under the DPDPA, 2023 upon the relevant provisions coming into force.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="8. Local Storage, Session Storage, and Cookies">
            <p>MaskedOn does <strong className="text-text">not</strong> use advertising cookies, third-party tracking pixels, or retargeting technologies. The Platform uses browser-native storage mechanisms only, as follows:</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">8.1 localStorage (persists until manually cleared)</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li><code className="bg-bg/40 px-1 rounded text-xs">access_token</code> — your JWT access token, used to authenticate API requests. Short-lived; automatically refreshed.</li>
              <li><code className="bg-bg/40 px-1 rounded text-xs">refresh_token</code> — your JWT refresh token, used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires without requiring re-login.</li>
              <li><code className="bg-bg/40 px-1 rounded text-xs">maskedon-theme</code> — your UI theme preference (dark or light mode).</li>
              <li><code className="bg-bg/40 px-1 rounded text-xs">maskedon-onboarding-done</code> — a flag indicating whether you have completed the onboarding flow.</li>
              <li>Draft event creation data — temporarily saved form data for Events you have started creating but not yet submitted, to prevent data loss on page refresh.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">8.2 sessionStorage (cleared when the browser tab or window is closed)</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>API response cache — a budget-capped (maximum 2MB) in-memory cache of recent API responses, persisted to sessionStorage for performance optimisation. This data is non-personal metadata about platform resources such as Event listings and User profiles you have recently viewed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">8.3 No Third-Party Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>MaskedOn does not load or deploy any third-party advertising, tracking, or social sharing cookies and does not participate in cross-site tracking or behavioural advertising networks. MaskedOn may collect first-party interaction data through its own Platform infrastructure for the purposes of service improvement, feature development, and enhancing user experience as described in Section 4.5.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">8.4 Clearing Storage</strong></p>
            <p>You can clear all localStorage and sessionStorage data at any time through your browser or device settings. Clearing localStorage will log you out of the Platform on that device and remove all locally stored preferences. This does not delete your Account or any data stored on MaskedOn's servers.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="9. Push Notifications">
            <p>9.1 MaskedOn requests permission to send push notifications only at the time you first launch the application or explicitly navigate to the notifications settings. Push notifications are <strong className="text-text">opt-in only</strong>. We do not send notifications without your prior consent.</p>
            <p>9.2 When you grant push notification permission, your device generates a unique push notification token. This token is transmitted to MaskedOn's backend and stored in our database associated with your Account. It is shared with Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google LLC) solely for the purpose of routing notifications to your device.</p>
            <p>9.3 Push notifications may be sent for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Event join request approvals or rejections by Hosts;</li>
              <li>New friend requests or approvals;</li>
              <li>New Social Ratings received;</li>
              <li>New direct messages received;</li>
              <li>Upcoming Events you are registered for;</li>
              <li>Platform updates or announcements (infrequent).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>9.4 You may revoke push notification permission at any time through your device's operating system settings (iOS: Settings → Notifications → MaskedOn; Android: Settings → Apps → MaskedOn → Notifications). Revoking permission does not delete your Account or affect any other Platform functionality.</p>
            <p>9.5 Upon Account deletion, your device push notification token will be permanently removed from our systems within the 30-day data retention window described in Section 12.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="10. Direct Messages and Communications Privacy">
            <p>10.1 Direct messages exchanged between Users through the Platform's messaging feature are stored on MaskedOn's servers (hosted by Supabase) to enable reliable message delivery and conversation history retrieval.</p>
            <p>10.2 Direct messages are <strong className="text-text">end-to-end encrypted</strong>. MaskedOn's servers store encrypted message content and cannot read the plaintext content of your private messages. The encryption and decryption occurs on your device. Only you and the intended recipient can read your messages.</p>
            <p>10.3 Notwithstanding Section 10.2, MaskedOn may, in response to a valid court order or lawful government authority directive, provide encrypted message data to the relevant authority. MaskedOn cannot decrypt such data and will only provide what is technically accessible.</p>
            <p>10.4 You may delete individual messages or entire conversations at any time through the messaging interface. Deletion of messages removes them from your visible conversation history; the timing and completeness of deletion from server infrastructure follows the same 30-day cycle as Account deletion under Section 12.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="11. Security Measures">
            <p>MaskedOn implements the following technical and organisational security measures in accordance with Rule 8 of the SPDI Rules, 2011 and Section 43A of the IT Act, 2000:</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">11.1 Data in Transit</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>All communication between your device and MaskedOn's servers is encrypted using <strong className="text-text">TLS (HTTPS)</strong>. Unencrypted HTTP requests are rejected or redirected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">11.2 Authentication Security</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Passwords are hashed using <strong className="text-text">bcrypt</strong> with individual per-password salts before storage. The original password is never stored.</li>
              <li>Authentication uses short-lived JWT access tokens (expiry configurable, typically 15–60 minutes) paired with longer-lived refresh tokens stored server-side with expiry enforcement.</li>
              <li>Refresh tokens are stored as hashed values in the database. Compromised refresh tokens can be individually revoked.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">11.3 Application Security</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>All database queries use <strong className="text-text">parameterised SQL statements</strong>, preventing SQL injection attacks.</li>
              <li>Rate limiting is applied to authentication and sensitive API endpoints to mitigate brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.</li>
              <li>Input validation is enforced server-side using schema validation (Zod), independent of client-side validation.</li>
              <li>User-uploaded images are processed through compression algorithms before storage, reducing attack surface from malicious file uploads.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">11.4 Infrastructure Security</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Database infrastructure is hosted on Supabase, which maintains SOC 2 Type II compliance and implements row-level security, encrypted backups, and access controls.</li>
              <li>MaskedOn's backend servers implement access controls ensuring that only authorised processes can connect to the database.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">11.5 Limitation of Security Guarantees</strong></p>
            <p>No security system is impenetrable. MaskedOn cannot guarantee absolute security of data transmitted over the internet or stored in electronic systems. In the event of a security incident that affects your personal data, MaskedOn will take the actions described in Section 13 (Data Breach Response).</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="12. Data Retention">
            <p><strong className="text-text">12.1 Active Accounts</strong></p>
            <p>MaskedOn retains your personal data for as long as your Account is active and as necessary to provide you with the Platform's services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">12.2 After Account Deletion</strong></p>
            <p>When you delete your Account through Settings → Delete Account:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Your Account is immediately deactivated and no longer accessible to other Users.</li>
              <li>MaskedOn retains your personal data for a period of <strong className="text-text">thirty (30) days</strong> from the deletion request. This window allows for Account recovery in the event of accidental deletion.</li>
              <li>After the expiry of the 30-day period, all personally identifiable data associated with your Account — including your email address, display name, profile photo, bio, phone number, date of birth, device tokens, messages, and friend/block lists — will be <strong className="text-text">permanently and irreversibly deleted</strong> from MaskedOn's active systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">12.3 Data Retained Beyond 30 Days</strong></p>
            <p>The following data may be retained beyond the 30-day period to the extent required by Applicable Law:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li><strong className="text-text">Transaction records</strong> (payment amounts, Razorpay reference IDs, dates) — retained for up to <strong className="text-text">seven (7) years</strong> as required under the Income Tax Act, 1961, the Goods and Services Tax framework, and general accounting regulations. These records will be stripped of directly identifying personal information to the extent technically feasible.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-text">Server access logs</strong> containing IP addresses — retained for up to <strong className="text-text">ninety (90) days</strong> for security and abuse investigation purposes, after which they are automatically purged.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-text">Anonymised, aggregated data</strong> (e.g., "X events were created in City Y in Month Z") that does not identify you may be retained indefinitely for analytical and product development purposes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong className="text-text">12.4 Backup Systems</strong></p>
            <p>Deleted data may persist in encrypted backup copies maintained by Supabase for a period of up to thirty (30) days following deletion, after which backup copies are overwritten or purged in accordance with Supabase's backup retention schedule.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">12.5 Inactive Accounts</strong></p>
            <p>In accordance with the DPDP Rules, 2025, if your Account remains inactive — meaning there has been no login, API interaction, or other engagement with the Platform — for a continuous period of <strong className="text-text">three (3) years</strong>, MaskedOn will initiate the erasure of your personal data. Before such erasure, MaskedOn will notify you at the email address associated with your Account at least <strong className="text-text">forty-eight (48) hours</strong> in advance, providing you with an opportunity to re-engage with the Platform and retain your Account.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">12.6 Minimum Retention of Processing Logs</strong></p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the above, MaskedOn shall retain personal data, associated traffic data, and processing logs for a minimum period of <strong className="text-text">one (1) year</strong> from the date of collection, as required under the DPDP Rules, 2025 and applicable directions issued by CERT-In.</p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="13. Data Breach Response">
            <p>13.1 In the event that MaskedOn becomes aware of a security incident that results in, or is reasonably likely to result in, unauthorised access to, disclosure of, or loss of personal data ("Data Breach"), MaskedOn will:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>Investigate the incident promptly to assess its nature, scope, and impact;</li>
              <li>Take immediate technical steps to contain and mitigate the breach;</li>
              <li>Notify the <strong className="text-text">Data Protection Board of India</strong> within <strong className="text-text">seventy-two (72) hours</strong> of becoming aware of the breach, providing a detailed report including the nature and extent of the breach, the number of affected Data Principals, the likely impact, and the remedial measures taken, as required under the DPDPA, 2023 and the DPDP Rules, 2025;</li>
              <li>Notify affected Users <strong className="text-text">without unreasonable delay</strong> via in-app notification and/or email, providing information about the nature of the data affected, the steps taken to address it, and any recommended actions you should take;</li>
              <li>Report the incident to the <strong className="text-text">Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In)</strong> within <strong className="text-text">six (6) hours</strong> of noticing the incident, as required under the Directions issued by CERT-In under Section 70B of the IT Act, 2000;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>13.2 MaskedOn's notification obligation is subject to any law enforcement or regulatory instruction to delay notification pending an investigation.</p>
            <p>13.3 If you suspect that your Account has been compromised or that your personal data has been accessed without authorisation, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:team@maskedon.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">team@maskedon.com</a> with the subject line "SECURITY INCIDENT".</p>

          <Section title="14. Your Rights as a Data Principal">
            <p>Under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and the SPDI Rules, 2011, you have the following rights in relation to your personal data:</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">14.1 Right of Access</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to obtain confirmation of whether MaskedOn is processing your personal data and to receive a summary of the data held and the processing activities undertaken. You can view much of your data directly through your profile and settings. For a complete data summary, submit a request to <a href="mailto:team@maskedon.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">team@maskedon.com</a> with the subject line "DATA REQUEST — ACCESS".</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">14.2 Right of Correction</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal data corrected or completed. You can edit most profile data directly through the Settings page. For data you cannot update through the Platform interface, contact us at <a href="mailto:team@maskedon.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">team@maskedon.com</a> with the subject line "DATA REQUEST — CORRECTION".</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">14.3 Right of Erasure</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to request the erasure of your personal data where it is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected, or where you withdraw consent (where consent is the sole lawful basis for processing). You can delete your entire Account through Settings → Delete Account, which initiates the 30-day deletion process described in Section 12. For targeted deletion of specific data, contact us at <a href="mailto:team@maskedon.com" className="text-primary hover:underline">team@maskedon.com</a> with the subject line "DATA REQUEST — ERASURE".</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">14.4 Right of Data Portability</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to receive a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.

We will endeavour to provide your data within thirty (30) days of receipt of a verified request.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">14.5 Right to Withdraw Consent</strong></p>
            <p>Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out before the withdrawal. Note that withdrawal of consent to the core data processing described in Section 4.1 will necessitate Account deletion as the Platform cannot be provided without processing foundational personal data.</p>
            <p><strong className="text-text">14.6 Right to Grievance Redressal</strong></p>
            <p>You have the right to have your grievances regarding the processing of your personal data addressed by MaskedOn.

            <p>15.1 MaskedOn is an adult social platform intended exclusively for individuals aged <strong className="text-text">18 years and older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 18.</p>
            <p>15.2 Age is verified through self-declaration at registration (date of birth and checkbox confirmation). MaskedOn does not use government ID verification for age confirmation at registration, but reserves the right to request identity verification at any time where there is reasonable suspicion of age misrepresentation.</p>
            <p>15.3 If MaskedOn becomes aware that a person under the age of 18 has created an Account or provided personal data through the Platform, we will promptly delete the Account and all associated data without notice.</p>

          <Section title="17. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling">
            <p>17.1 <strong className="text-text">Social Rating Algorithm.</strong> MaskedOn uses an automated algorithm to calculate your Social Rating — a recency-weighted average of ratings submitted by other Users following Events. This calculation is automated and not subject to human review or adjustment by MaskedOn staff except in cases of suspected manipulation as described in the Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>17.2 <strong className="text-text">Feed Algorithm.</strong> The Platform uses an algorithmic feed to determine the order in which Events and content are displayed to you. This algorithm considers factors such as your social connections, event attendance history, location (if provided), and engagement patterns. It does not make decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects on your rights.</p>
            <p>17.3 <strong className="text-text">Profiling Limitations.</strong> MaskedOn does not engage in profiling for the purposes of credit scoring, insurance pricing, employment assessment, or access to financial products. MaskedOn may analyse user engagement and interaction patterns to personalise your experience, optimise Platform features, and improve service quality. Such analysis does not produce legal or similarly significant effects on your rights beyond the Platform context described in these Terms.</p>

            <p>18.2 The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page reflects the date of the most recent revision. We recommend that you review this Policy periodically.</p>
            <p>18.3 Your continued use of the Platform after the effective date of a revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If you do not accept the revised Policy, you must cease using the Platform and delete your Account before the changes take effect.</p>
